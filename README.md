**Problem Statement**
Millions of students lack access to science labs, reducing curiosity and understanding of core STEM concepts.
**Target Audience**
Rural and low-resource schools; NGOs promoting digital literacy.
**3 Innovative Features**
1.	**Browser-Based AR Labs** – Students simulate real experiments (chemistry, physics) using WebAR and motion tracking.
2.	**Voice-Guided Tutor AI** – Real-time experiment explanations using TTS and context-based NLP.
3.	**Offline Lab Packs** – Downloadable experiment bundles that run locally without internet.
**Technical Feasibility:** 8/10
Three.js or AR.js + simple AI tutor backend + pre-rendered assets make it doable within hackathon time.
**Impact & Scalability**
Could partner with educational boards or edtech startups — highly fundable as an inclusive STEM learning tool.
