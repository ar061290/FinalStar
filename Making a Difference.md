### **Why did you choose this project?**

I chose this project after recognizing a persistent gap between theoretical chemistry education and meaningful hands-on experimentation, especially for students with limited access to physical laboratories. While chemistry is often taught through memorization and abstract equations, many students struggle to visualize reactions or safely experiment beyond textbook examples. I wanted to address this gap in a way that was scalable, safe, and accessible to learners regardless of resources or location. This project allowed me to combine my interest in chemistry, education, and technology to create a solution that empowers students to explore concepts independently. Rather than relying on pre-existing tools, I identified the specific learning barriers students face and designed a platform that actively supports curiosity, experimentation, and understanding. Choosing this project was a deliberate decision to create a student-driven educational tool that makes science more engaging, equitable, and intuitive.

### **How did you make a difference through this project?**

I made a difference by creating an educational platform that enables students to actively engage with chemistry concepts through guided experimentation rather than passive learning. The project transforms how students interact with chemistry by allowing them to simulate experiments, test hypotheses, and understand outcomes without safety risks or material constraints. This directly benefits students who lack access to laboratories, chemicals, or formal experimentation environments. By focusing on clarity, accessibility, and learner autonomy, the project supports deeper conceptual understanding and confidence in science learning. Additionally, the platform encourages inquiry-based learning, helping students think like scientists rather than simply memorizing results. The difference lies not only in the tool itself but in how it shifts the learning experience toward independence, curiosity, and exploration, which I think are key qualities needed for long-term academic growth and scientific literacy.

### **What were the key processes that you followed for this project?**

The project followed a structured yet iterative process driven by problem identification, design, testing, and refinement. I began by researching common challenges students face in chemistry education, particularly the lack of safe, hands-on experimentation. From this, I defined clear goals focused on accessibility, educational value, and usability. I then designed the system architecture and user flow, ensuring the platform would be intuitive for students while maintaining scientific accuracy. Development involved building and testing core features, evaluating outputs, and refining explanations to ensure clarity. Throughout the process, I continuously reflected on whether each feature genuinely supported learning rather than adding unnecessary complexity. Documentation was created alongside development to clearly record decisions, functionality, and outcomes. This disciplined process ensured the final project was both technically sound and educationally effective.

### **How did your project have a positive impact?**

The project’s positive impact lies in expanding access to meaningful science learning experiences. By offering a virtual environment for experimentation, it can remove barriers related to cost, safety, and infrastructure that often prevent students from engaging fully with chemistry. Students can explore reactions, observe outcomes, and learn from mistakes without fear or limitation. This fosters confidence, curiosity, and deeper understanding. The project also supports teachers by providing a supplementary learning tool that can reinforce classroom concepts or enable independent study. Over time, this can improve engagement in STEM subjects and encourage more students to pursue science-related fields. The impact will be measurable through improved conceptual clarity, increased student participation, and the ability to learn anytime and anywhere. Ultimately, the project will contribute to a more inclusive and empowering educational ecosystem.

### **How was your project innovative?**

The project is innovative because it reimagines chemistry learning as an interactive, student-led experience rather than a static curriculum. Instead of replicating traditional lab manuals or videos, it integrates experimentation, explanation, and reflection into a single platform. The innovation lies in combining accessibility with scientific rigor, which allows learners to experiment freely while still receiving structured guidance and accurate outcomes. Unlike many existing tools that focus only on visualization, this project emphasizes decision-making, hypothesis testing, and learning from results. It also adapts complex chemical concepts into intuitive interactions that reduce cognitive overload. By prioritizing learner autonomy and experimentation over instruction alone, the project introduces a fresh approach to STEM education that aligns with how students naturally learn and explore.

### **What next steps could you take or will you take to further make a difference with this project?**

The next steps focus on scaling impact and improving educational depth. I plan to expand the range of experiments and concepts covered, allowing the platform to support more advanced topics and diverse curricula. Feedback from users will guide refinements to usability and learning effectiveness. Another step is collaborating with educators to align features more closely with classroom needs and assessment standards. I also aim to explore partnerships with schools or educational organizations to reach underserved communities. In the long term, adding progress tracking and adaptive learning features could personalize the experience for each student. These steps ensure the project continues to grow sustainably while remaining focused on its core mission: making high-quality, hands-on science learning accessible to all.

### **What adult support did you receive to help with this project?**

Adult support for this project was limited to guidance rather than direction. Mentors provided occasional feedback on feasibility, clarity, and alignment with educational goals, helping me reflect on my decisions without making them for me. They did not design features, write content, or control the project’s direction. All core ideas, planning, development, and execution were student-led. This balance ensured the project benefited from experience-based advice while preserving my ownership and independence. Adult input functioned as a sounding board, allowing me to refine my thinking and strengthen the project without compromising agency. This support structure helped maintain high standards while ensuring the project remained authentically driven by student initiative and decision-making.
